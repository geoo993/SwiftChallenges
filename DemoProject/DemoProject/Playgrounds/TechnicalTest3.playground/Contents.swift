/*
 A small frog wants to get to the other side of the road.
 The frog is currently located at position X and wants to get to a position greater than or equal to Y.
 The small frog always jumps a fixed distance, D.
 
 Count the minimal number of jumps that the small frog must perform to reach its target.
 
 write a function that, given three integers X, Y and D, returns the minimal number of jumps from position X to a position equal to or greater than Y.
 
 For example, given:
 
 X = 10
 Y = 85
 D = 30
 the function should return 3, because the frog will be positioned as follows:
 
 after the first jump, at position 10 + 30 = 40
 after the second jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 = 70
 after the third jump, at position 10 + 30 + 30 + 30 = 100
 Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
 
 X, Y and D are integers within the range [1..1,000,000,000];
 X â‰¤ Y.

    let max = 1000000000
    var counter = X
    var steps = 0

    let remainder = gap % D
    //let gap = (remainder + X)
    //let includingFirstPosition = gap / D
    print(minimumTimes, remainder)//, gap, includingFirstPosition)
    //let steps = minimumTimes //+ includingFirstPosition
    return remainder > 0 ? minimumTimes + 1 : minimumTimes
