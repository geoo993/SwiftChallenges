/* Creational Design Patterns
 
 Creational patterns are dealing with the creation or construction of objects and its is not that simple than you think but sure you have explicit creations which is where you call a constructor. But are also situations where the creation of an object is actually implicit for example you might be using a Dependency Injection Framework or you might be using Reflection or some other mechanism which actually creates an object behind the scene. This is also creational but it is not as explicit as creating a constructor.
 In addition there are different processes of actually initializing the object before they ready to be used, so sometimes you have Wholesale creation of an object meaning that a single state creation like a singleton constructor call, is actually sufficient to initialise an object but in certain situations initialisation itself is a complicated process and this is where we get a so called piecewise or step-by-step initialisation which is where you need to have several statements or several steps that needs to be taken before a object actually initialised and ready to use.

 /* Structural Design Pattern

 Structural design patterns as the name suggest the structural pattern is mainly concerned with structure of the classes that are involved here. So it is concerned with class member or concerned with things like a class adhering to an interface. And so what we tend to see here is many patterns which are wrappers which mimics the underlying interface, so you have a wrapper around the class and that wrapper tries to mimic as much as possible the underlying class that it is actually wrapping. Structural design patterns are generally put extra weight on the importance of good API design and of the patterns are actually all about this idea of replicating interfaces as much as possible or making the interfaces as convenient to use as possible. So in studying structural patterns you are going to see some applications of good API design that makes object usable and makes API usable for other people.

/* Behavioral Design Patterns
 
 Behavioral design patterns which are unlike the creational pattern and structural patterns, behavioural patterns do not really follow any central theme, they are all doing their own different thing, there is some overlap here and there so for example, the Strategy and the Template Method design patterns, they are kind of doing the same thing but they are doing it using completely different object-oriented mechanisms. So there is going to be some overlap here and there, but generally most behavioural design patterns are unique in their approach. Meaning that they solve a particular problem, they solve it in a particular way, they have a particular set of concerns.
