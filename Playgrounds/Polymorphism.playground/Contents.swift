    // the above defines three classes: albums, studio albums and live albums, with the latter two both inheriting from Album.
    // Because any instance of LiveAlbum is inherited from Album it can be treated just as either Album or LiveAlbum â€“ it's both at the same time.
    // This is called "polymorphism," where it means you can write code like this:
    
    var taylorSwift = StudioAlbum(name: "Taylor Swift", studio: "The Castles Studios")
    var fearless = StudioAlbum(name: "Speak Now", studio: "Aimeeland Studio")
    var iTunesLive = LiveAlbum(name: "iTunes Live from SoHo", location: "New York")

    for album in allAlbums {
        // here you can see the true nature of polymorphism
        // We will automatically use the override version of getPerformance() depending on the subclass in question.
        // That's polymorphism in action: an object can work as its class and its parent classes, all at the same time.
        print(album.getPerformance()) // This approach will perform dynamic dispatch

example(of: "typecasting") {
    // You will often find you have an object of a certain type, but really you know it's a different type. Sadly, if Swift doesn't know what you know, it won't build your code.
    // So, there's a solution, and it's called typecasting: converting an object of one type to another.
    
    // Chances are you're struggling to think why this might be necessary, but I can give you a very simple example:
    
    for album in allAlbums {
        print(album.getPerformance())

        // Typecasting in Swift comes in three forms, but most of the time you'll only meet two: as? and as!, known as optional downcasting and forced downcasting. The former means "I think this conversion might be true, but it might fail," and the second means "I know this conversion is true, and I'm happy for my app to crash if I'm wrong."
