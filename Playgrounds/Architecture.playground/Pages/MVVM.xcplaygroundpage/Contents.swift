/*
MVVM - separates objects into 3 types, Models, Views and View Models. Controllers still do exist in MVVM, but they aren't the main focus of the pattern, instead, View Models are. So instead of a controller owning models directly, it now owns View Models and the View Models will run the Models. This allows View Models to act as an intermediary to the Models and perform a critical role such as, transforming Model data into a View representation.
MVVM-C - is the Model View ViewModel design pattern, combined with C which is the coordinator pattern.
Coordinator pattern - is a pattern that help manage app navigation, it provides an encapsulation of navigation logic and enables reusability. Essentially itâ€™s a pattern for organising flow logic between view controllers. We use this pattern to decouple view controllers from one another. The only component that knows about view controllers directly is the coordinator. Consequently, view controllers are much more reusable. If you want to create a new flow within your app, you simply create a new coordinator!
