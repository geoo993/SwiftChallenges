/* Snapshot testing -

These are an easy way to ensure that the UI doesnâ€™t change unexpectedly when you modify your code.
 It is a powerful method of testing visual components that works by comparing a snapshot of your UI with a previously-stored reference image, if the two images are the same, the test will pass.
 If the images are different, the test will fail, and you know something has changed your UI.
