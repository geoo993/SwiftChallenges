// Closure capture semantics can sometimes be tricky, especially with that last contrived example. Just remember these key points:
// - Swift closures capture a reference to the outer variables that you happen to use inside the closure.
// - That reference gets evaluated at the time the closure itself gets executed.
// - Being a capture of the reference to the variable (and not the variable‚Äôs value itself), you can modify the variable‚Äôs value from within the closure (if that variable is declared as var and not let, of course)
// - You can instead tell Swift to evaluate a variable at the point of the closure creation and store that value in a local constant, instead of capturing the variable itself. You do that using capture lists expressed inside brackets.
